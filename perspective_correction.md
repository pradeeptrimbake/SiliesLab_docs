# How to verify the set up and perspective correction: 

## I. Verify the set up:  
<br>

1. Measure the real distance of the fly eye to the screen, given a 45° angle of the head. 
- a direct measure using the artificial fly holder equipped with a piece of paper that has a 45° angle resulted in 5cm (Figure [1A](#L17)).
- an indirect measurement measuring the straight distance of the fly to the point where the screen touches the holder results in 4.6cm distance
- we decided to assume the distance (D) to be 4.8cm

## II.	Verify perspective correction:
<br>

1. Calculate the size a given angle (α) would correspond to on the screen in cm at the center position (angular position=0°) (Figure [2A](#L34)): 

   $$a = (\tan(\frac{\alpha}{2}) \times D) \times 2 $$
   
2. For calculating the object size at different angular positions we calculated the delta of two object sizes:  E.g.: 10° size at position 30°: Calculate a (35°) – a (25°).

### Angular postions

| Angular size | 0°     |10°    |20°    |30°   |
|:------------ |:-------|:------|:------|:-----|
| 5°           | 0.4191 |0.4322 | 0.4748|0.5592|
| 0°           | 0.8399 |0.8662 | 0.9521|1.1227|
| 0°           | 1.6927 |1.7471 | 1.9249|2.2806|
| 0°           | 3.4941 |3.6177 | 4.0277|4.8740|
